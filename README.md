# My dotfiles

My opinionated config files for zsh, nvim and others...

## How to install

### Manually

1. `git clone git@github.com:al20ov/dotfiles.git`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `cp ./.* ~/`

### With the install script

TODO: Write an install script that determines which distro it is running
on and installs zsh, nvim, maybe other programs and unpacks all my config files.
